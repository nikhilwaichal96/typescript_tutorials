## What is typescript?

- Typescript is superset of Javascript.
- On top of Javascript typescript provides Strict type checking, object orient programming.
- Javascript doesn't check syntax, variable types It wont throw any error/warning at time of development it throws error at runtime.
- With help of typescript we can catch issues in code beforehand thus saves lot of time and provides security due to type checking
- Typescript provides oops principles like Classes, Inheritance, Object, Interface, Generics, Decorators.


## Advantage of Typescript
1.Type safety
2. Well syntax checking before compilation
3. Follows oops principle
4. Used for readable and maintainable codes
5. Typescript compiler we will get error beforehand
